# Word Frequency in Classic Novels

## Introduction:

The project aims to analyze the word frequency distribution in classic novels. In this specific example, Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick, is chosen as the subject of analysis. The project utilizes various Python libraries and techniques to scrape the novel from the Project Gutenberg website, extract the words, remove stop words, and determine the most frequent words.

## Project Steps:

- Importing Libraries:
  
The necessary libraries are imported, including requests, BeautifulSoup, nltk, and Counter. These libraries provide functionality for making HTTP requests, parsing HTML, performing natural language processing tasks, and counting word occurrences.

- Scraping the Novel:
  
The HTML content of Moby Dick is obtained by sending an HTTP request to the Project Gutenberg website. The HTML response is then encoded properly to handle special characters.

- Extracting Text:
  
Using BeautifulSoup, the text content is extracted from the HTML by creating a BeautifulSoup object and calling get_text() on it. This allows us to parse and extract the relevant text from the HTML structure.

- Tokenization and Word Processing:
  
The extracted text is tokenized using a regular expression-based tokenizer from the nltk library. This tokenizer splits the text into individual words or tokens based on word characters. The tokens are then transformed to lowercase and stored in a list called words.

- Removing Stop Words:
  
Stop words, which are common words that do not carry significant meaning, are removed from the list of words. The nltk library provides a list of English stop words, which are used to filter out unnecessary words. The resulting list of words without stop words is stored in words_ns.

- Counting Word Frequencies:
  
A Counter object is initialized with the processed list of words (words_ns). The Counter class from the collections module provides a convenient way to count the occurrences of each word in the list. It creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are words, and the values are their respective counts.

## Determining the Most Common Words:

The most common words and their counts are extracted from the Counter object using the most_common() method. In this example, the top ten most common words are stored in the top_ten variable.

## Printing Results:

The top ten most common words and their counts are printed to the console, allowing us to see the frequency distribution of words in Moby Dick. The most common word in the novel is 'whale' and is assigned to the variable most_common_word.

## Conclusion:

The project demonstrates a data science pipeline for analyzing word frequency in classic novels. By leveraging web scraping, text processing, and natural language processing techniques, it becomes possible to gain insights into the distribution of words and identify the most frequent terms in a given text. This pipeline can be applied to other classic novels available on Project Gutenberg or extended to analyze word frequencies in different types of text data.
